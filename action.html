    <h2>Use reusable bag!</h2>
    <p >We use a lot of plastic bags when we buy clothes and foods. Most of these plastic bags are incinerated in waste disposal plants and generate carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide, which rises into the atmosphere and blends into clouds, causing acid rain, not only damage to the ocean but also to animals, marble sculptures and humans. Some plastic bags that flow into the sea, causing great damage to marine life. To reduce this damage, we can protect the marine ecosystem by using reusable bags instead of plastic bags that are difficult to reuse.</p>

    <h2>Let's clean the beach!</h2>
    <p> Many people go to the beach for vacation in summer. Many people have fun on the beach and take good memories with them, but leave trash on the beach. These abandoned wastes flow into the sea and pollute the sea. To prevent this, if you traveled to the beach, let's clean up the trash we made.</p>

    <h2>Let's reduce the use of detergent!</h2>
    <p> The detergents we commonly use at home flow through sewers into contaminated water treatment facilities. In the process, however, some contaminated water flows into rivers or small valleys, severely affecting the ecosystems in rivers and valleys. In addition, this contaminated water leaks into the sea, creating bigger problems. What we can do to solve this problem is reduce the use of detergents and use natural soap or detergents. Natural soaps and detergents are made from natural ingredients, so there is less damage than detergents even if they are spilled into rivers or valleys. </p>
